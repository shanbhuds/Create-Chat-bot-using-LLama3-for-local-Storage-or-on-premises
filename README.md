Create Chat bot using LLama3 for local Storage or on premises 
Creating a chatbot using Llama3 for local storage or on-premises involves several steps, including setting up the environment, programming the bot to handle user interactions, and ensuring it can access and store data locally. While I don't have specific instructions for Llama3, I can provide you with a general approach:

1. **Environment Setup**: Install Llama3 and any necessary dependencies on your local server or on-premises environment.
2. **Programming the Bot**: Develop the chatbot's logic using Llama3's framework, defining how it will process and respond to user inputs.
3. **Data Handling**: Implement local storage solutions, ensuring that the chatbot can access and store data securely on your local server without relying on external cloud storage.
4. **Testing**: Rigorously test the chatbot in your local environment to ensure it handles queries as expected and interacts with local storage correctly.
5. **Deployment**: Once tested, deploy the chatbot within your local network or on-premises infrastructure.

Please note that you'll need to refer to Llama3's documentation for specific coding guidelines and API usage. 
If you have access to a development team, they might be able to assist with the technical details.
